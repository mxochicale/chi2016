Hi all,

I thought it would be a good idea for all of us to share our reviews & scores,
so we have an overall idea of which papers have a good chance of getting in, and
also can help each other out where needed.

I also have a simple script to calculate the average weighted score (the one you
would see in PCS as a reviewer). You can just feed it a reviews.txt file from
PCS, as follows:

$ $ ./chiscore.py review-2699.txt
Scores: 3.5 (exp. 3), 3.5 (exp. 4), 2.5 (exp. 4), 4.0 (exp. 3)
Average score: 3.34

As the email system might tag this as a virus, you can download the Python
script here: https://www.dropbox.com/s/htpng3owf1q4ie7/chiscore.py?dl=0

It has been my experience that papers above 3.25 have a reasonable chance of
getting in with a good rebuttal and bumped up scores (those above 3.5 of course
stand a better chance). Papers below 3 are more difficult. Those below 2.5
typically do not make it to the PC meeting, but writing a rebuttal can still
help, you never know.  The 1AC (primary) and 2AC (secondary) scores are also
essential. Andrew, Russell, Rowanne, Chris, feel free to add insights from your
experience.

Reviews for papers I'm involved in are attached. Here are the scores:

Heartefacts

Scores: 3.0 (exp. 3), 2.5 (exp. 3), 3.0 (exp. 2), 4.0 (exp. 3), 2.0 (exp. 3)
Average weighted score: 2.90

Comments: 

Under the Radar

Scores: 2.0 (exp. 3), 2.5 (exp. 2), 3.5 (exp. 2), 1.5 (exp. 2)
Average weighted score: 2.35

My Phone and Me

Scores: 3.5 (exp. 3), 3.5 (exp. 4), 2.5 (exp. 4), 4.0 (exp. 3)
Average weighted score: 3.34

So it would be great if you could all share your reviews and scores as well :)

Cheers,

-- Jo
