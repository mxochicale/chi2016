ACM CHI 2016: the top conference for Human-Computer Interaction [:link:](https://chi2016.acm.org/wp/)
---

# Call for Papers
For those who are finding out about CHI – pronounced kai – for the first time, 
CHI is a place to see, discuss and learn about the future of how people interact 
with technology. At any minute you might experience a new gesture interface 
for tablets, learn how developing countries use mobile phones for maternal 
health, play soccer against someone 3000 miles away, or debate the future of 
online education. You’ll meet with top researchers from universities, 
corporations and startups from across the world, as well as the brightest 
student scientists, designers, and researchers. It’s a place to find your 
community, to talk about your toughest problems, and to find your next job.

For those who have been to CHI before, we think there will be much for you 
to get excited about. With careful consultation from the community, 
we have enhanced the CHI conference experience from submission and review 
processes, to more participation possibilities at the conference. 
Peer reviewed papers have more space for references and will receive a 
wider range of better-matched reviews.
There are more curated venues and more input into the selection of keynote 
speakers. We’ve even added an optional day of service before the conference 
– #chi4good. Bring your design ideas, innovative research, HCI teaching and 
more as we see how HCI tools and methods can be used to help the 
under-served, under-resourced, and under-represented.

Join us in the heart of Silicon Valley, San Jose, California for this 
important conference, and gathering of the world-wide HCI community.
