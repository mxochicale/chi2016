Hi all,

The rebuttal phase for CHI will start next week (reviews should go out on the
18th of November). Here are some tips on how to structure and write a good and
condense rebuttal:

Please also notice that they probably only contact the 1st author, so it's
probably a good idea to send your notification and reviews around to all your
co-authors as well.

Cheers,

Hi all, 

Alan, I haven't noticed the Elsevier spam, so I guess I might not be in their
list yet :)

Although most reviewers are assigned now, if anyone still wants to sign up for
CHI reviewing, you can do so on the PCS system:

http://precisionconference.com/~sigchi/

If you sign in, you can go to the volunteer center, indicate how many papers you
would be willing to review, and update your experience so you get relevant
papers assigned. Definitely also good to volunteer for other upcoming SIGCHI
conferences or the CHI Works-in-Progress track by early next year.

I personally feel I learned a lot from reviewing for conferences like CHI, UIST
and Ubicomp as a PhD student. Just being able to see how authors handle
rebuttals, how more experienced reviewers write their reviews, how the
discussion takes place, etc. is very useful. So definitely recommended :)

Cheers,

-- Jo
